# Grav Shopping Cart Skeleton

The *Shop Shopping Cart* skeleton is a [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) skeleton and includes a *user* folder giving an example of a native Grav Shopping Cart set up using Grav.

# Installation

To install this package, you will essentially be replacing the default `user` folder with the skeleton. To do this, download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/`. Then, rename the folder to `user`.

If a user folder already exists, back up the folder to a safe place, delete it (if there is no custom content in it you wish to keep) or replace its contents with the KANA#s in the unzipped folder.

You should now have all the skeleton KANA#s under

	/your/site/grav/user/

>> NOTE: This skeleton is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and several plugins to be installed, plus the Antimatter theme. If you download this skeleton from GitHub directly, make sure you run `bin/grav install`.
